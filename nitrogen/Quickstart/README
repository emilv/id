To get started with Nitrogen quickly, simply run:


./quickstart.sh


This will:
 - Compile the Nitrogen Web Framework.
 - Compile the sample files.
 - Start Nitrogen on top of Erlang's built in Inets server on port 8000.

Then, open your browser to http://localhost:8000

To start a new project, run "make rel_inets", "make rel_mochiweb",
or "make rel_yaws" in the root directory of Nitrogen, and then base
your project in "./rel/nitrogen".
